Features
--------
- Generate phone numbers in a variety of formats:
  - Plain formats: 123xxxxxxx, 1+123xxxxxxx

  - Parentheses formats: (123) xxx-xxxx, 1 (123) xxx-xxxx
  - International formats: +1 123 xxx xxxx
  - Shortened local formats: xxxxxxx (local dialing)
- Supports dynamic area code input for flexibility.
- Default output file includes the area code (e.g., 123-wordlist.txt).
- Memory-efficient: Writes generated phone numbers directly to a file without overwhelming system resources.

Applications
------------
The wordlists generated by PhoneSmith can be utilized in various security and testing scenarios, including:
- **Password Cracking**: Use the wordlists with popular tools like:
  - [John the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) for brute force password attacks.
  - [HashCat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) for fast, GPU-accelerated hash cracking.
- **Penetration Testing**: Generate phone number lists for testing phone systems and related infrastructure.
- **Data Analysis**: Simulate datasets for phone number analysis or system testing.

Disclaimer
----------
The phone numbers generated by this tool are purely hypothetical and programmatically generated. They do not represent or reference real-world phone numbers or users. This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only.

Installation
------------
Clone the repository to your local machine:

cd PhoneSmith

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. If not, download it from python.org.

Usage
-----
Run PhoneSmith using the command line:

python3 PhoneSmith.py [area_code] [--output OUTPUT]

Command-Line Arguments
----------------------
- area_code (optional): The 3-digit area code for the phone numbers (e.g., 123). If not provided, the script will prompt you to enter it interactively.
- --output OUTPUT (optional): The output file to save the wordlist. Defaults to <area_code>-wordlist.txt.

Examples
--------
1. Generate phone numbers for area code 123 and save to 123-wordlist.txt:
   
   python3 PhoneSmith.py 123

3. Generate phone numbers for area code 456 and save to mylist.txt:
   
   python3 PhoneSmith.py 456 --output mylist.txt

5. Run the script without an area code (interactive prompt):
   
   python3 PhoneSmith.py
   
   Please enter a 3-digit area code: 789
   
   PhoneSmith is crafting phone numbers for area code 789...
   
   Wordlist saved to 789-wordlist.txt
   

Output
------
The generated file will contain all possible phone numbers in the specified formats, for example:

1230000000
1+1230000000
1-123-000-0000
(123) 000-0000
+1 123 000 0000
